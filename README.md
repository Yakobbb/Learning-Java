# Learning-Java
Projects I've done to help me learn Java! Not for any other specific purpose

This is just a place where these mini-projects are stored. Each of these was made as a separate project in Eclipse; therfore,
each folder will contain the source files, class files, class path, and an executable JAR file.

NOTE: To run the JAR, you may have to use bash depending on your system configurations.
