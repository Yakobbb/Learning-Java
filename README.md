# Learning-Java
This is just a place where these mini-projects are stored. Each of these was made as a separate project in *Eclipse* or *IntelliJ*; therfore,
each folder will contain the source files, class files, class path, and IDE-specifc files.

## NOTE 
To run a `.JAR` (if there is one), you may have to use `bash` depending on your system configurations.
